# NYCU Data Visualization
In this class, the works are done with javascript and the D3 library

## Assignment 1
In this homework, your goal is to implement a web-based scatter plot to show the attached iris dataset by using D3. Users should be able to determine the x-axis (and y-axis) to show the values of one of the attributes, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, when interacting with the tool. Besides, please render scatter points in different colors to represent the flower classes (three in total). In this case, the attribute relations of different flowers can be further visualized.

## Assignment 2
In this homework, your goal is to implement a web-based parallel coordinate plot to show the iris dataset (the same as your homework #1) using D3. Users should be able to change the order of the axis because the attribute relations are difficult to observe if they are far away. Besides, please render poly-lines (flower samples) in different hues to represent the flower classes (three in total). In this case, the attribute relations of different flowers can be further visualized.

## Assignment 3&4
In homework #3+4, your goal is to implement an integrated system that can show the insight of Spotify Tracks Dataset.

You are free to decide which idioms to use and how interactions to provide in your system. There are no rules in this homework. The grading depends on how much information your system can reveal. Accordingly, in addition to submitting your codes, you have to write a short report describing the story in the dataset.
